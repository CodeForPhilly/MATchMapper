    <p>The Philadelphia area is among the regions hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. Fortunately, Philly is also home
        to hundreds of dedicated professionals skilled at treating opioid use disorder. However, information on these
        providers is split across several search tools and is sometimes outdated or innaccurate. MATchMapper aims to
        address these issues by providing a search tool that unifies existing data sources and corrects many errors. We
        hope that this tool will be useful to many in the community including individuals seeking treatment, healthcare
        providers making referrals, and public health officials seeking to understand treatment availability. Please do
        not hesitate to <a href="mailto:matchmapper.philadelphia@gmail.com">contact us</a> with questions and
        suggestions.</p>
    <h2 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h2>
    <p>MATchMapper builds on the excellent work of existing projects to produce an extensive, up-to-date database of
        treatment resources. The original data sources can be found below:</p>

    <h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>
    <p><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/projects/matchmapper">MATchMapper</a> is a project of <a
            href="https://codeforphilly.org">Code for Philly</a>, the local chapter of <a
            href="https://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>, a nation-wide not-for-profit network of
        volunteers who apply their technical skills to a variety of civic challenges. The project began in February 2020
        as part of Code for Phillyâ€™s Opioid Data Hackathon. Since then, our team has continued to improve the
        MATchMapper tool, benefitting greatly from feedback from a variety of public health experts in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p>A large roster of volunteers has made MATchMapper possible. Our team includes a mix of students and experienced
        professionals with skills in areas including web development, data science, product management and research.</p>
